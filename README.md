# Portfolio Website

A portfolio site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was created as a way to practice core web development skills while building a place to share projects.

## Contents
- `index.html` for the site structure  
- `style.css` for layout and design  
- `darkmode.js` for theme switching  
- `images/` folder for visuals  
- `files/` folder for extra project content  

## Focus Areas
- Writing clear and organized HTML  
- Using CSS for layout and styling  
- Adding interactivity with JavaScript (dark mode)  
- Organizing assets into a simple folder structure  

## Key Takeaways
This project strengthened my understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together. It was a chance to practice building a complete site and keeping the code easy to follow.

## Next Steps
- Add more sections to highlight projects  
- Improve responsiveness for mobile devices  
- Refine the design and accessibility features
